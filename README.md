the title of this repo has nothing to do with kidneys but rather with assets for game development.

it is a collection of scalable vector graphics for use as backgrounds in various exercises of interactive story telling.

most of you who embarked on any software development project that contain graphics would know how painful it is to find good quality assets which often end up playing only supporting role to the actual game play, story line, game mechanics, business logic or simple presentation of other type of content or media.

I like to have access to such graphics just for the ease of experimenting with potential themes and ideas.

it isn't a repository of placeholders but it might be used in this manner and it is released under gpl-v30.

most of the pictures that were traced and turned int vector graphics were created by lukasz and kasia

and this song will haunt you for the rest of the day.
